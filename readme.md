The finding_donors.impnb Notebook is a Udacity Lab in which I
created and executed a Supervised Learning pipeline in order
to find potential donors for a fictitious charity 'CharityML'.
The data for the project is included, was provided by Udacity, 
and is 1994 california census data.  The aim of the project is
EDA on the data set, data formatting, feature consideration, potential
model selection.  Model evaluation, tuning, and metrics.

Python version 3.7.3 was used to complete this project.
