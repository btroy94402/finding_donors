The finding_donors.impnb Notebook is a Udacity Lab in which I
created and executed a Supervised Learning pipeline in order
to find potential donors for a fictitious charity 'CharityML'.  
Python 3.7 & Scikit-Learn were used in a Jupyter Notebook.
The data for the project (included) was provided by Udacity, 
and is 1994 California Census data.  The aim of the project was
EDA of the data set, formatting, feature consideration,
model selection, model evaluation, model tuning, and metrics.
