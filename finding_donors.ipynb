    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted.

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Answer:  \n",
    "    I've decided to evaluate three Ensemble methods for this project.  Based on prior learning, as well as learning from this Udacity ML course it seems that Ensemble methods generally perform better than individaul models working in isolation.  This is based on \"The Wisdom of Crowds\" and regression to the mean.  This essentially stipulates that with many partially informed guesses, the ditribution of answers will go toward a gaussian distibution around the mean of the true answer.  Ensemble models effeectively 'take votes' from many individual models as opposed to just relying on the outcome of a single classification model.  The Ensemble models that I've chosen to evaluate initially are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "    The Random Forest model is an extension of Bagging or 'Bootstrap aggregating' (which utilizes bootstrapping to create randomized samples of the data & creates a tree for each).  With Bagging, the resulting tree is then a weighted average of all the component trees.  With the Random Forest, however, the featureset is also sampled.  Generally, sqrt(total # features) works well for the number of features randomly subsetted for each tree.  Unlike a single decision tree, there is no pruning with a Random Forest so all trees are fully grown.  Essentially, the two main hyperparameters to tune are 1) The number of trees, and 2) the Number of features in each subset.  Additional Random Forest hyperparameters tend to have marginal impact on predictive accuracy (https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/random-forest.html).\n",
    "    - According to techopedia.com, one example of a Random Forest model used in industry, is in prediction of Wine Quality based on factors such as acidity, sugar, SO2 levels, pH and Ethanol content.\n",
    "        - A core strength of this model is simplicity of implementation.  The Random Forest model performs well out of the box becasue there are really only two significant hyperparameters (mentioned above) to tune.  Random Forests can be used for both classification and regression, and predictive run-time is fast.\n",
    "        - A weakness of this model is with Regression. It cannot extraploate outside the boundaries of the training data set.  Additionally, as with all Ensembles, it is computationally expensive relative to a single classifier model.\n",
    "        - The CharityML dataset contains 103 features which is a significant amount.  The Random Forest model is good at handling this level of complexity while other classifiers may not be.  The dataset also contains many binary attributes after one hot encoding, and the Random Forest model handles binary data well as it's based on decision tree splitting.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Ada Boost\n",
    "    AdaBoost is short for \"Adaptive Boosting\".  It is a Boosting algorithm becasue it learns through iteration, where only one 'weak' learner is trained per step.  Generally, AdaBoost uses decision tree 'stumps' as the weak learner(https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/gradient-boosting/).  A learner is weak because it is only slightly better than a naive model.  With each iteration, the resulting model error is fed forward to the next iteration, and the model weights are adjusted to favor those instances that were misclassified in the prior model.  The performance of the final model is greater than the sum of it's parts.    \n",
    "    - According to a 2018 paper out of the University of China School of Communication, the AdaBoost Algorithm can be effectively used for fraud detection in the Telecommunications industry.\n",
    "    - A strenght of AdaBoost is, According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost), Unlike neural networks and SVMs, the AdaBoost training process selects only those features known to improve the predictive power of the model, reducing dimensionality and potentially improving execution time as irrelevant features need not be computed.  Additionally, it's an ensemble, which generally have shown superior performance to single classifier models.\n",
    "    - A disadvantage of AdaBoost according to educba (https://www.educba.com/adaboost-algorithm/) is that when weak learners are too weak, they can lead to low margins and overfitting.\n",
    "    - Given the CharityML dataset, and for the same reason stated above, Adaboost is a good candidate given the data because of it's use of decision trees.  They are good with binary attributes.  Also, given 103 features, and AdaBoost's ability to reduce dimensionality, it seems a good candidate for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boost\n",
    "    Gradient boosting is similar to AdaBoost with some key differences.  According to this blog,  (https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/gradient-boosting/), those include:  1) Gradient Boost attempts to minimize a diffentiable loss function of a model as opposed to focusing on misclassified data points, 2)   Gradient Boost decision trees are based on purity scores, so trees can have more levels than AdaBoost (~4-8 levels) as opposed to a stump.  All learners have equal weights with Gradient boost.  The weight is usually set as the learning weight.\n",
    "    - According to the paper \"Predictive analytics with gradient boosting in clinical medicine\" (2019), In the clinical literature, gradient boosting has been successfully used to predict, among other things, cardiovascular events (2), development of sepsis (3), delirium (4) and hospital readmissions following lumbar laminectomy (5). \n",
    "    - According to the UC Business Analytics R Programming Guide (http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression), some key advantages of Gradient Boosting are:\n",
    "        - Often provides predictive accuracy that cannot be beat.\n",
    "        - Lots of flexibility - can optimize on different loss functions and provides several hyperparameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible.\n",
    "        - No data pre-processing required - often works great with categorical and numerical values as is.\n",
    "        - Handles missing data - imputation not required.\n",
    "    - The same site also mentions these disadvantages:\n",
    "        - GBMs will continue improving to minimize all errors. This can overemphasize outliers and cause overfitting. Must use cross-validation to neutralize.\n",
    "        - Computationally expensive - GBMs often require many trees (>1000) which can be time and memory exhaustive.\n",
    "        - The high flexibility results in many parameters that interact and influence heavily the behavior of the approach (number of iterations, tree depth, regularization parameters, etc.). This requires a large grid search during tuning.\n",
    "        - Less interpretable although this is easily addressed with various tools (variable importance, partial dependence plots, LIME, etc.).\n",
    "    - Given the CharityML dataset, this algorithm would have been a good candidate even before one hot encoding becasue it often works great with categorical and numerical values as is.  Additionally, it is a good candidate in light of the fact that this project will implement Grid Search later to tune the hyper-parameters."

    "\n",
    "Based on the initial results obtained by building three Machine Learning Classifier Models using 1994 California Census data, I believe that a Gradient Boosting classifier will be the best of the three at predicting which Californians make more than $50,000 annually.  There are multiple ways to interprete the results of a Machine Learning classifier which include but Accuracy, Precision, Recall, an F1 Score and a Fb score.  Accuracy is the most straight forward as (correctly classified/total data points), but also the most misleading.  It's value can appear better or worse than it really is based on the number of positives in the total population.  As a result, we look at other metrics such as Recall, Precision, and Fbeta.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall is another metric which can be used to gauge a classifier's perfomance.  It is not relevant for CharityML, however, because with a high value it will tell you how many positives were predicted of all the posatives in the State of California.  In laymans terms, \"Did I reach everyone who is making \\\\$50,000?\"  While somewhat important, it's more important to prevent sending requests to people who don't make at lease \\$50,000 anually.  A high value of Precision will allow you to do this.  Precision is the way to measure how many correct positive classifications were present in a population of predicted positive classifications (P = True positives/(All Predicted Positives)).  This metric is appropriate for CharityML because it will save you money on postage.  The metric which I used to select the best model is called the Fbeta score.  It's a weighted metric that takes both Precision and Recall into account, but based on your use case gives more precedence to Precision than Recall.  I accomplish this by assigning the weight (beta value) to be 0.5.  If I instead wanted to give more precedence to Recall, then I would have assigned a beta value of 2 or higher.  Of the three models initially screened, The Gradient Boosting Classifier gave the best Fbeta score on the testing data set.  This can be seen in the bottom right plot above.  The Fbeta score on the full test data set was 0.74.   This is the highest of the three candidates, and is a reasonable score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training time for this model was 7.74 seconds on the full data set.  This is significant, relative to the other classifier model candidates.  However, given the task at hand this is in the noise when considering the money that will be saved by not sending mailers to improper donation candidates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient boosting algorithm is suitable for this data set because it 'learns' with each training iteration from the mistakes of the prior Ensemble model.  Instead of just averaging them all, it gets better as it goes.  It can handle both regression for your continuous variables, and classification for your categorical variables.  Those considerations make the Gradient Boosing Classifier the Model of Choice for this CharityML project."

    "The Gradient Boost Classifier Model is what's called an Ensemble Classifier Model.  Ensemble means that multiple classifier models are \"Daisy Chained\" together to get a better result than if you were using any one of them individually.  The Gradient boost algo uses individual 'Decision Tree' classifiers to iteratively compute its final result.  A decision tree is effectively a 'flow chart' of decisions that need to be made to arrive at a final conclusion for a given data point (person).  For example, in the case of CharityML, \"Is the person male or female?\"  OK, then \"What does the person do for work?\", etc. These decision trees eventually guide the computer to a decision about whether that person makes more than \\\\$50,000 annually.  The method of creating a decision tree classifier is to create internal boundaries, so that new unlabeled data can be input (with an unknown salary) and salary predicted based on those input values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Gradient Boost algorithm, these individual decision tree classifiers are called 'Weak learners'.  They are weak because any one of them is only marginally better than a random guess.  One weak learner tree might excel when considering marital status, but be bad at age, and education level.  Another may excel at relationship status, but be bad at race, and capital gains.  These would be examples of 'Good' weak learners.  Another weak learner may be just 'ok' at all attributes, but great at none.  This is an example of a 'Bad' weak learner.  What makes them good or bad is in the ability of the algorithm to assign each a specific task.  For instance, with good weak learners, one would be the classifier that considers marital status, while the next considers relationship stataus.  In reality, they're considering all features, however those specific features at which they excel carry a lot more weight with those specific classifiers.  In the case of bad weak learners, none of thier considerations will carry much weight.  In the end all weak learners get a 'Vote' in the formation of the final classifier, but because of the weights each carry, the successful predictors will win out for each attribute, and the final Gradient Boost product will be better than the sum of it's parts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This briefly described how we 'Train' the Gradient Boost classifier.  With that classifier, we will apply it to the Census data for the entire State of California.  The classifier will look at the various input variables for each person, and will predict how much that person makes anually.  With that information, CharityML will be able to send mailers requesting donations only to people who fit the criteria for a 'Good' potential donor (eg. Make more than \\\\$50,000 annually) and won't need to waste effort on dead ends."

    "Of the five features I selected, none were selected by feature_importances_.  This goes to show that the problem at hand is non-intuitive.  My choice of 'Relationship' is similar to 'Marital-Status' in motivation, however, it appears that more information is gleaned from the later.  Additionally, my choice of 'education level' is similar to 'education-num'.  Once again it appears that more information can be gleaned from education number.  Capital gain and Capial loss immediately imply a salary higher than $50,000, however I decided that this would cover a significantly small part of the data set as to not be in the top 5.  In retrospect, this was a bad assumption.  "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The Accuracy and Fbeta scores were only marginally less good than the initial model build from all features.  The time on the other hand is significantly improved.  Given the right circumstance, I would choose the smaller feature set to save time and to avoid the potential to overfit the model. With this project, however, dimensionality reduction does not reveal the prior presence of overfitting, and the money saved on mail with correct classification far outweights the extra time that may be taken to predict salaries for the entire state.  So, no, in this case, I would not use the reduced feature set."
