    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this. (Normalizes to value between 0 and 1)."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Answer:  \n",
    "    I've decided to evaluate three Ensemble methods for this project.  Based on prior learning, as well as learning from this Udacity ML course it seems that Ensemble methods are very well suited to this type of classification project (includes categorical AND continuous data) and Ensemble models generally do well in Kaggle ML competitions.  The Ensemble models that I've chosen to evaluate initially are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "    - According to techopedia.com, one example of a Random Forest model used in industry, is in prediction of Wine Quality based on factors such as acidity, sugar, SO2 levels, pH and Ethanol content.\n",
    "    - According to theprofessionalspoint.blogspot.com, The strenghts of the model include resistance to overfitting, because it builds multiple decision trees.  Additionally, it can handle both classification and regression data.  It does well with large data sets.\n",
    "    - According to a blog at blog.citizennet.com, A key weakness of the model is that with regression, it cannot extrapolate beyond the range of the training data.  Additionally, the multiple individual tress are trained independently of each other, so there isn't a feed forward mechanism that is present in Gradient Boosing (below).\n",
    "    - The Random Forest Model is a good candidate for the CharityML dataset because it is resistant to overfitting and can handle large data sets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Ada Boost\n",
    "    - According to a 2018 paper out of the University of China School of Communication, the AdaBoost Algorithm can be effectively used for fraud detection in the Telecommunications industry.\n",
    "    - According to easyai.tech, AdaBoost makes good use of weak classifiers for cascading, different algorithms can be used as weak classifiers, AdaBoost has a high degree of precision, and AdaBoost fully considers the weight of each classifier.\n",
    "    - According to the same site, data imbalance leads to a decrease in accuracy, and the training is time consuming.\n",
    "    - Because the CharityML dataset contains both continuous and categorical data, AdaBoost is a good candidate becasue it can make use of different classification algorithms as weak classifiers.\n",
    "- Gradient Boost\n",
    "\n",
    "    - According to the paper \"Predictive analytics with gradient boosting in clinical medicine\" (2019), In the clinical literature, gradient boosting has been successfully used to predict, among other things, cardiovascular events (2), development of sepsis (3), delirium (4) and hospital readmissions following lumbar laminectomy (5). \n",
    "    - According to frontiersin.org, rather than just averaging lerner models, they are trained sequentially.  At each training iteration, the Gradient Boosting model is trained based on the error of the preceeding model so far.  This is contrary to the method used with Random Forest models.  In this way, the overall performance is enhanced relative to simply averaging various models.  This also makes the Gradient Boost Models customizable to any particular data driven task.\n",
    "    - One of the cons of gradient boosting is that the training takes longer as each tree is trained sequentially based on the result of prior tree trainings.  Additionally, the hyper-parameters are not trivial.\n",
    "    - The Gradient Boost Ensemble method appears to be a good candiate for this ML project as it is highly customizable to different data sets, and generally optperforms other models."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on the initial results obtained by building three Machine Learning Classifier Models using 1994 California Census data, I believe that a Gradient Boosting classifier will be the best of the three at predicting which Californians make more than $50,000 annually.  There are multiple ways to interprete the results of a Machine Learning classifier which include but Accuracy, Precision, Recall, an F1 Score and a Fb score.  Accuracy is the most straight forward as (correctly classified/total data points), but also the most misleading.  It's value can appear better or worse than it really is based on the number of positives in the total population.  As a result, we look at other metrics such as Recall, Precision, and Fbeta.  \n",
    "    Recall is another metric which can be used to gauge a classifier's perfomance.  It is not relevant for CharityML, however, because with a high value it will tell you how many positives were predicted of all the posatives in the State of California.  In laymans terms, \"Did I reach everyone who is making $50,000?\"  While somewhat important, it's more important to prevent sending requests to people who don't make at lease $50,000 anually.  A high value of Precision will allow you to do this.  Precision is the way to measure how many correct positive classifications were present in a population of predicted positive classifications (P = True positives/(All Predicted Positives)).  This metric is appropriate for CharityML because it will save you money on postage.  The metric which I used to select the best model is called the Fbeta score.  It's a weighted metric that takes both Precision and Recall into account, but based on your use case gives more precedence to Precision than Recall.  I accomplish this by assigning the weight (beta value) to be 0.5.  If I instead wanted to give more precedence to Recall, then I would have assigned a beta value of 2 or higher.  Of the three models initially screened, The Gradient Boosting Classifier gave the best Fbeta score on the testing data set.  This can be seen in the bottom right plot above.  The Fbeta score on the full test data set was 0.74.   This is the highest of the three candidates, and is a reasonable score.\n",
    "    The training time for this model was 7.74 seconds on the full data set.  This is significant, relative to the other classifier model candidates.

    "    The gradient boosting algorithm is suitable for this data set because it 'learns' with each training iteration from the mistakes of the prior Ensemble model.  Instead of just averaging them all, it gets better as it goes.  It can handle both regression for your continuous variables, and classification for your categorical variables.  Those considerations make the Gradient Boosing Classifier the Model of Choice for this CharityML project."

    "The Gradient Boost Classifier Model is what's called an Ensemble Classifier Model.  Ensemble means that multiple classifier models are \"Daisy Chained\" together to get a superior result than if you were using any one of them individually.  The algorithm iteratively trains a classifier, then computes the error of the model.  This model along with it's error values are then fed forward into the next iteration where the algorithm can 'pay more attention' to the model components which caused error in the last iteration.  As a reult, the resulting model performs much better than an equivalent would without the feed forward mechanism.  \n",
    "    In your date set , each of the attributes (age, sex, education level, etc.) in the data set are plotted in a multidimensional space.  You can think of it as an X,Y,Z cartesian plane with more axes than you can conceptually visualize.  In this multidimensional space, each data point (person from the census data) will tend to exist in some specific region with similar other people.  We don't know what those similarities will be at start, but the properly utilized algorithm finds them.  Thats the fun part.  With the set of people plotted in the multidimensional space, the Gradient Boost Algorithm looks at them and looks for which ones (in the training set) make more than $50,000 anually.  It then tries to draw multidimentional plane or 'hyperplane' which can separate those folks from the others who don't make at least $50,000 anually.  The way it does this is by looking for a multi-dimensional linear or polynomial equation that can draw that boundary plane.  The better the separation that can be achieved, the better the classifier.  The way to measure the goodness of the separation plane is by finding out how many data points get misclassified, and by how much.  The magic of the Gradient Boost is that after building the separation plane, it checks it against some data to determine where it wasn't so good.   It then tries to build a new plane based on the old one, but pays a bit more attention to where to 'bad' spots were in the last iteration.  With this 'Feed Forward' mehcanism to address the model's error the final version will be much more robust that if it were only traind once discretely."

    "Of the five features I selected, none were selected by feature_importances_.  This goes to show that the problem at hand is non-intuitive.  My choice of 'Relationship' is similar to 'Marital-Status' in motivation, however, it appears that more information is gleaned from the later.  Additionally, my choice of 'education level' is similar to 'education-num'.  Once again it appears that more information can be gleaned from education number.  Capital gain and Capial loss immediately imply a salary higher than $50,000, however I decided that this would cover a significantly small part of the data set as to not be in the top 5.  In retrospect, this was a bad assumption.  "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
